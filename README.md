# Security Camera using OpenCV
The goal is to develop a system that uses a webcam to identify human faces or bodies. Once the system detects either a face or a body, it will automatically capture and store the image in a designated folder. This process of detection, extraction, and saving occurs without manual intervention. By utilizing this technology (OpenCV), a higher level of security can be achieved, risks are reduced, and better protection for homes, offices and public facilities can be provided. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop a security camera system that utilizes digital image processing to detect threats using OpenCV, as well as integrating voice notifications that can provide an automatic alarm when a threat is detected. Thus, this technology offers a powerful and efficient solution for improving home security through digital image processing.
